# Margay-guide
A guide on setting up and potentially troubleshooting a Margay data logger

### Physical materials I needed
- Margay data logger (ATMega 1284p 8 MHz)
    - This is a small data logger that will eventually collect data in the field, but it needs to be set up and programmed before it can do that.
- Programmer (AVR ISP mkll)
    - This is a device that will allow us to **burn a bootloader** (I'll define this below) onto the Margay board.
- USB-C cable
    - I used this to connect my laptop to the logger after initially burning a bootloader, to keep the logger connected to power. In the field, a battery would supply power.
- My laptop
    - To download softwares and upload programs to the Margay logger.
